## Overview
Based on the popular game Cookie Clicker, in this project, we aim to combine the incentives of games with the practical benefits of learning to type (quickly and accurately). HotDog Typer is a fun and interactive visual experience for types of all ages, sizes, and backgrounds to embrace their keyboard literacy. This type of game is coined an "incrementer" game, as proclaimed by Orteil. The point of the game is to create hotdogs by clicking on a giant hotdog, then buy more upgrades to increase your hotdog-tivity.
